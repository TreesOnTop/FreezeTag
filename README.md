A plugin made for [RacingFanToo on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/RacingFanToo) that adds a freezetag minigame to minecraft. It is recommended to play with 1 freezer and 3+ runners but is playable with any amount of players. You may use this in any video modified or unmodified as long as you provide credits in the description of the video.
